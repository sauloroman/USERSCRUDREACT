# Users CRUD

As proof of the use of HTTP methods, I developed this responsive web application that allows you to perform the four operations of digital data management: create, read, update and delete.

To achieve this, everything was based on an API that handles user administration. The application has modal windows and a user-friendly graphical interface.
